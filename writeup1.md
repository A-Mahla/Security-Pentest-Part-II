## Step 0 - Find the iso ip

To start, you need to know the ip iso to connect to it. Since we've configured the VM to be in the local network,
we look at our network interfaces:
```shell
host:~$ ip a
...
3: vboxnet0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 0a:00:27:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.56.1/24 brd 192.168.56.255 scope global vboxnet0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
...
```
So we can deduce that the ip will be in range `192.168.56.2-255`, let's use `nmap` to find it !
```shell
host:~$ nmap 192.168.56.2-255
...
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.7
Host is up (0.00019s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
143/tcp open  imap
443/tcp open  https
993/tcp open  imaps
...
```
Yes, We got it. So we can connect through the iso on ip `192.168.56.7`.

## Step 1 - find a doorway.
Now, we know the ip and all open ports. Let's enumerate them:
<br>
-  `21` and `22` are respectively `ftp` and `ssh` ports and we don't have any credential so there aren't useful for the moment.
  
-  On port `80` (http port) we find a interesting information :

As we deduce the http/https ports might be the path we were expecting to enter the iso. We list the possible paths using `dirb`.

```shell
host:~$ dirb http://192.168.56.7
...
==> DIRECTORY: http://192.168.56.7/fonts/
+ http://192.168.56.7/forum (CODE:403|SIZE:285)                              
+ http://192.168.56.7/index.html (CODE:200|SIZE:1025)                        
+ http://192.168.56.7/server-status (CODE:403|SIZE:293)
...                     
```
We found nothing useful on `80` let's test the `443` port

```shell
host:~$ dirb https://192.168.56.7
...
==> DIRECTORY: https://192.168.56.7/forum/
==> DIRECTORY: https://192.168.56.7/phpmyadmin/
...                     
==> DIRECTORY: https://192.168.56.7/webmail/
...
```
Here we found that we expected, 3 possible doorway: phpmyadmin, webmail (both needed credentials) and ... a private forum with free access to topics !
